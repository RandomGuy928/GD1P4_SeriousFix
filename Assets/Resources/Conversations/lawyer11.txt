text=Good afternoon.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=Oh, hello.  How’s the lawyering going?
speaker=Hans Frank
text=I’ve had better days.  I presume you are aware of the current Jew conundrum?
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=I know the basics.  Pity about the Grabowski family, I never would have thought it of them.
speaker=Hans Frank
text=Anyways, my men and I are visiting all your homes to deliver a reminder.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=And what might that be?
speaker=Hans Frank
text=If you are sheltering the Jews, we strongly recommend you stop, for your sake.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=That seems obvious.  I wasn’t exactly expecting you to encourage hiding them.
speaker=Hans Frank
text=I’m running out of patience with this town and that includes you.  Keep your jokes for someone else.
