text=Michael, these Nazis are insane!
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=They do seem a bit obsessive.
speaker=Sebastian Zielinsky
text=These crazy assholes are charging into my bar every night and interrogating my patrons.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=I can only imagine your frustration.
speaker=Sebastian Zielinsky
text=They don’t even bother to buy a drink for their troubles.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=A true affront to decency.
speaker=Sebastian Zielinsky
text=You’re not taking me seriously?  It’s ruining my business!

speaker=Sebastian Zielinsky
