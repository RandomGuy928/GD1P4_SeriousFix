speaker= Patryk Jankowski
text=Michael, how do you have so many customers?  Even my regulars are reluctant to come.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=People need to eat somehow.  Besides, I appear to have special status, thanks to the lawyer who is running the operation.
speaker= Patryk Jankowski
text=That crazy guy?  I told him to leave my store and never come back.  Idiot tried to tell me how to run my own business.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=I see that as usual, you miss the irony of that particular decision.
speaker= Patryk Jankowski
text=Whatever.  This needs to end.  I barely got enough money today for a loaf of bread.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=I agree that this situation is untenable.  I’m not sure what we can do about it though.
speaker= Patryk Jankowski
text=I don’t know…I was hoping you’d have another brilliant idea.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=Oh right, I had forgotten about that.  How did the list thing go?
speaker= Patryk Jankowski
text=Eh.  It didn’t, really.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=What went wrong?
speaker= Patryk Jankowski
text=Turns out Father Mazur doesn’t trust many people generally, and this situation only has made that worse.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=So the list was too long?
speaker= Patryk Jankowski
text=That and it changed every day.  I just don’t know, Michael- what can we do about this?  There’s got to be something.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=I promise, one way or another, this will be resolved in a day or two.
speaker= Patryk Jankowski
text=I really hope so.  I’m pretty sure the town’s future depends on it.
