speaker=Dorota Nowak
text=Michael, we don’t have much time, you need to listen carefully.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=I’m listening.
speaker=Dorota Nowak
text=You are familiar with Klaudia Grabowski?
speaker=Dorota Nowak
text=Yes, the seamstress.  She was just in the other day.  Apparently, she had guests over.
speaker=Dorota Nowak
text=Michael…those guests were the Jewish family.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=Pardon me?
speaker=Dorota Nowak
text=Klaudia is, or was, a member of the Polish Underground State.  She has been helping Jews move through our city for years to bring them to freedom.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=I had no idea.
speaker=Dorota Nowak
text=She was very good.  One of the best, in fact.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=You keep using the past tense.  And why are you bringing all this to my doorstep?
speaker=Dorota Nowak
text=They got her, Michael.   The Nazis.
speaker=Dorota Nowak
text=They intercepted a letter to her from the next guy down the line, and arrested her within the hour, but they didn’t know where she was keeping the Jews.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=Okay, so again, why are you bringing this all to my doorstep?  I’m really not one for idle town gossip.
speaker=Dorota Nowak
text=That’s exactly why.  I was able to save the Jews- they’re waiting around the corner.
speaker=DorotaNowak
text=I need you to keep them in your house.  Before you moved in, someone like Klaudia lived there.  There’s a secret room.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=Yes, I found it a few years back.  I wondered why it was there; I guess now I know.
speaker=Dorota Nowak
text=Please, Michael, I’m begging you- take the Jews.  Let them stay in that room until we can move them safely to their next destination.
speaker=DorotaNowak
text=Nobody else has the resources to feed them and such a good hiding spot.

text=For God’s sake, grow a heart.  These people are going to be sent to a concentration camp and die horribly if you don’t help them.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=Better them than my own family.
speaker=Dorota Nowak
text=You honestly believe that?  You would stand by and watch innocents die?
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=So my own, equally innocent family can live?  No question.
speaker=Dorota Nowak
text=You’re a cruel man, Michael Kowalski.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=No, I’m a realist.  Life is hard, Dorota.  Tough decisions have to be made.  And this is one I will make without hesitation.

text=Thank you.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=I hope you know where they are supposed to get to from here?
speaker=Dorota Nowak
text=Yes, there’s a family a few miles west who can hold them for a few days.
speaker=Dorota Nowak
text=I was thinking you could hide them under a cloth in one of the wagons you use to get grain from the farms.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=Sounds possible.  Bring them in; I’ll do what I can.
