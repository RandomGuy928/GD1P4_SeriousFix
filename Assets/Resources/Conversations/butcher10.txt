speaker= Patryk Jankowski
text=Have you heard the news?
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=No, that’s what I have you and Dorota for.
speaker= Patryk Jankowski
text=It’s crazy- Marta and her whole family were taken in for questioning by the Nazis.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=Whatever for?
speaker= Patryk Jankowski
text=Apparently they were hiding Jews.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=So why questioning?  If they were hiding Jews, isn’t that the death sentence?
speaker= Patryk Jankowski
text=That’s why this is so crazy!  The Jews got away.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=Now that’s not something you hear every day.  The Jews escaped the house ransack and everything?
speaker= Patryk Jankowski
text=Yep.  And the best part is, nobody knows where they are.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=Someone always knows.  You just have to ask the right person at the right time.
speaker= Patryk Jankowski
text=You got any ideas on who they should ask?
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=Not particularly.  The Father stopped by here recently with a rant against Jews.
speaker= Patryk Jankowski
text=He’s been going on and on about that in services too.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=Maybe you could ask him for a list of people he doesn’t trust?
speaker= Patryk Jankowski
text=That’s a great idea!  Thanks, Michael, I can always rely on you for good advice.
