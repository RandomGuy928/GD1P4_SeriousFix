text=Well, Michael, it’s certainly been a rough few days for your little village.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=I’ll say.  How’s the search for the Jews going?
speaker=Hans Frank
text=No headway, sadly.  Not a single lead.
speaker=Hans Frank
text=For a tiny town where, according to the delightful Dorota, nothing is secret, you folk are managing to keep that family very well hidden.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=My wallet is very sorry to hear that and wishes you the best.
speaker=Hans Frank
text=And what of your heart?
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=I don’t know.  I’m not sure how I feel about any of this anymore.  I guess you’ve pushed me, and everyone else, pretty hard.
speaker=Hans Frank
text=That was the goal.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=Then I guess you’ve done pretty well.
speaker=Hans Frank
text=I’m here to offer you a last chance.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=Those seem pretty common around here these days.
speaker=Hans Frank
text=Be that as it may, we are going to finish making the point we started.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=How do you plan to do that?  I’d say this town was on its last legs as is.
speaker=Hans Frank
text=There won’t be a town anymore.  All residents are being moved to Auschwitz.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=You’re going to move an entire town to a concentration camp with no evidence that they are doing anything wrong?
speaker=Hans Frank
text=Tomorrow, we will be holding a press conference.  It will be announced that the Jews have been found- whether or not they have been is irrelevant.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=So that’s why you’re doing this- to shut us up.  You don’t expect to find the Jews.
speaker=Hans Frank
text=No.  But I am willing to give you a last chance.  You strike me as a kindred spirit.
speaker=Hans Frank
text=If you give up the Jews, here and now, this can all end.  No Auschwitz, no lies, you will be spared of all charges.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=Why would you do that?
speaker=Hans Frank
text=Because I believe you will further our cause.
speaker=Hans Frank
text=If we can get you, a man clearly stubborn, prideful, and arrogant, to admit that he is hiding the Jews…we can get anyone to do so.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=I thought you just said I was like you.  If so, you describe yourself pretty harshly.
speaker=Hans Frank
text=I am all of those things.  I am also right.  So, will you give them up?  Can you tell us where they are?

Fine.  Yes.  God save me.  They’re in a hidden room.
speaker=Hans Frank
text=And where is the entrance to the hidden room located?
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=The closet next to the kitchen has a false back.
speaker=Hans Frank
text=Excellent.  Soldiers!  Arrest this man and his family as traitors and take the Jews into custody.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=What?  But you told me we would be pardoned.
speaker=Hans Frank
text=I lied.  Take him away.
