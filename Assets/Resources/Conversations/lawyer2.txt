text=Nice business you’re running here, Mr…
speaker = Michael Kowalski
text=Kowalski.  Thank you, I do my best.
speaker = Hans Frank
text=Indeed, your goods are top notch and your prices are surprisingly low.
speaker = Michael Kowalski
text=Well, I’m glad that I am meeting expectations.
speaker = Hans Frank
text=I admit a tad of concern about your prices, though.
speaker = Michael Kowalski
text=Why is that?
speaker = Hans Frank
text=I find that low prices tend to bring in the undesirables.
speaker = Michael Kowalski
text=The undesirables?
speaker = Hans Frank
text=Poor people, gay people, gypsies, Jews- the list goes on.
speaker=HansFrank
text=Inferior parasites who would ride Nazi Germany’s coattails into the greater future we work for while they laze about.
speaker = Michael Kowalski
text=And you recommend that I discourage them from shopping here?
speaker = Hans Frank
text=Only for your own good, of course.  They always ask for handouts, cheaper deals, more for less.  At first it seems innocent, but it gets worse and worse.
speaker = Michael Kowalski
text=Well, thanks for the heads up.
speaker = Hans Frank
text=But of course.  I love to see a successful businessman.
