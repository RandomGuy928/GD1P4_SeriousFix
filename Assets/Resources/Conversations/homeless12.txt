speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=Hey there.  Your father still hasn't let up?
speaker= Pietr Zielinski
text=No sir, Sebastian beat me when I tried to go home last night.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=And your mother didn't say anything?
speaker=Pietr Zielinski
text=I didn't see her, but I could hear her crying in another room.  Dad's been in a pretty bad mood recently.
speaker=Pietr Zielinski
text=Those guys from the government keep coming into the bar and interrogating his customers.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=I'm sorry, kid.
speaker= Pietr Zielinski
text=Can you give me a bite to eat?

text=But why not?  It’s cold and I’m hungry and I just want a roll or something!
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=Customers are scared everywhere, kid, not just your dad’s bar.  People are staying at home until this blows over.
speaker= Pietr Zielinski
text=What am I supposed to do?
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=Try Father Mazur.  He might have something for you.
speaker= Pietr Zielinski
text=I don’t like him though.  He’s always talking bad about people behind their back.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=Well, listening to him being judgmental is better than starving, isn’t it?
speaker= Pietr Zielinski
text=Yeah, I suppose so.  Thanks for the advice!
