text=Michael, good news!
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=That would be welcome right around now.
speaker=Dorota Nowak 
text=One of the Nazi guards approached me earlier- I guess he’s some kind of undercover agent.  He’ll give us an opening to escape town.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=Fantastic!  But why did he wait this long to tell us?
speaker=Dorota Nowak 
text=He needed confirmation from the next family that they were ready.  No point revealing himself and risking exposure until it was necessary.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=We’ll need to move the Jews tonight.  Tomorrow, they plan to move the whole town to Auschwitz.
speaker=Dorota Nowak 
text=What?  But that’s terrible.  We can’t possibly all escape.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=I know.  You need to guide the Jews to their next stop.
speaker=Dorota Nowak 
text=But what about you?
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=We’ll survive.  One way or another.  Maybe we’ll see you, when this hell ends.
speaker=Dorota Nowak
text=I’ll make this worthwhile.  I’ll join the resistance, save every life that I can.  And I’ll tell people how you helped.

text= Thank you.  If I'm going to die, might as well be in a blaze of glory.

text=Better not to.  As far as I can tell, the Nazis don’t know what I did.  If you spread the word, my family and I will be killed.  But thanks.  And good luck.
