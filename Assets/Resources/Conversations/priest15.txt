speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=Hey, Father, how’s it going?
speaker=Father Mazur
text=Not bad, my son.  How is your shop handling these troublesome times?
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=We’re keeping it together.  How’s all of this affecting the church?
speaker=Father Mazur
text=My congregation, as always, swells in the face of adversity.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=Makes sense, people looking to you for guidance when they don’t have the answers.
speaker=Father Mazur
text=Our Heavenly Father always provides.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=Delighted to hear it.
speaker=Father Mazur
text=In this case, he has inspired me to bring my flock together to pray that the cruel hearts of the wicked family who hides the Jews are turned back to his light and majesty.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=Really, now?  Are you having any luck in that endeavor?
speaker=Father Mazur
text=Sadly, not as much as I would have liked.  People are hiding in their homes, fearful of meeting an angry Nazi even just in route to the church.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=That’s a pity.  Well, if you don’t mind, I need to go back to my work.
speaker=Father Mazur
text=You cannot return with me to the church?  For you to come, it would be symbolic of the safety I provide.
speaker=Michael Kowalski
text=Sorry, Father.  I have a family to feed.  This food won’t sell itself.
